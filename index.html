        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a student at the University of California Riverside from a small town in southern California by the name of Hemet. Hemet has raised me through thick and thin and is one of the contributors to the way I am. This small town has brought me connections with my peers that in other towns would be seemingly impossible. This town has shown me how the trials and tribulations of our lives truly impact the future that we work towards. The schools and townspeople have expressed what living in a connected environment really means. With such a high population for such small land, connecting with people was never something hard to do. Throughout high school, I became highly influenced by the connections of others that I began to join clubs to speed up this process. With this in mind, my clubs have taught me not only how to connect with others, but also how to become a stronger leader. My experience in working towards my goal of becoming a team leader has made me grateful as it has brought me to where I am today. <br><br>

        My endeavors stem from a cycle of learning more about myself and how I can use the connections I’ve made within myself to better the world around me. Not only do I believe this is the most effective way to make the world a better place, but I believe that this makes me such a strong, competitive person within my peers. I take any sort of challenge and go at it with full effort. I have taken it upon myself to realize that in order for me to achieve my goals, I must be able to fear nothing that comes in the way of it. I hope to enlighten fear in the sense that I will fully embrace the fears that I have and use those to my advantage. Pain and struggle are just the beginning stages in my journey, and I must find ways to work with them in order to be as strong and successful as I wish to be. <br><br>

        I am an ambitious student pursuing a Psychology degree eager to contribute developed knowledge in a collaborative manner. Skilled in management and Communication in team settings. Adaptable and driven with a strong work ethic and the ability to thrive in team-based or individually motivated settings. I plan to use all of my previous experiences to create this strong worker within myself that I could put out in the field in which I wish to pursue in the future. This sense of stability was not instant. I have taken my years of experience and challenges as insight as to what makes me a strong, successful leader in the eyes of my peers and employers. I hope to successfully implement my struggle to also help others who are beginning to reach the levels of struggle in which I am able to help. Nothing in the workforce is as important as being able to work as a team as we all experience hardship.
